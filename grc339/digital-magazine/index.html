                                    The allure of a fight with Charles Oliveira isn't enough to lure Khabib Nurmagomedov out of his retirement from UFC. Okamoto threw out the idea of one day taking on Oliveira, who claimed the lightweight championship after defeating Michael Chandler at UFC 262 in May, if Oliveira ran through the rest of the 155-pound division.

                                    Dana White in a recent interview reported denying any sort of progression on the increase of lower level fighters pay.White has heard it all before. Many media members and some fighters have been calling for a change in pay structure. The biggest name who has expressed gripes over fighter pay is former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion, Jon Jones. “Bones” feels making anywhere between $8 million to $10 million to fight UFC Heavyweight Champion Francis Ngannou is too low.
