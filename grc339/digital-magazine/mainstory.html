                            <h3>Is This The End Of Conor McGregor?</h3>
                    
                                <p>After his most recent loss at UFC 264 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, is it possible for McGregor to bounce back from his devastating defeat?</p>

                                <p>While Conor landed some decent shots from the bottom, it was clear that Dustin was controlling the ground exchange. The guillotine McGregor attempted was not enough to defend himself against Poirer's strikes. Try as he might, McGregor couldn't escape the barrage of ground and pound and this was why the judges had scored the first round as 10-8 Poirier. </p>

                                <p>After a controversial interruption from Poirer complaining about McGregor holding his glove, the two were returned to their feet. That's when the last couple strikes of the fight would be thrown. McGregor would throw two kicks, possibly damaging or minorily facturing part of his Tibia. </p>

                                <p>The round would end with the terribly unfortunate sequence of events that would end up putting McGregor on a stretcher. After a terrible ankle roll, the bone in his leg would break badily and the doctor called the fight a doctor stoppage before the second round could begin.</p>

                                <p>The ugliness of the trilogy wouldn't stop there, as the two competitors would exhange nasty words in the post fight interviews with Joe Rogan. Regardless of how this fight ended, the bad blood between the two is far from over. McGregor continued to ridicule Poirier and his wife, continuing the barrage of insults that hovered over fight week. </p>

                                <p>
                                    With just under 45 seconds left in the O'malley vs. Moutinho opeining fight, Herb Dean stopped the action by TKO due to O'malley's relentless barrage of strikes.

                                <h3>Colby Covington Is Next For Kamura Usman, But Where Is Leon Edwards In All This?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After a dominating performance last month against star Nate Diaz, Leon is once again on the sidelines waiting for a title shot. With contenders like Jorge Masvidal, Gilbert Burns, and Micheal Chiesa, it makes you wonder if Leon will take a fight before is expected title shot sometime next year.
